# Resume Section Extraction

The automatic PDF extraction was unsuccessful due to lack of proper PDF extraction tools available in this environment. 

To properly organize your resume into sections, please:

1. Open your original resume document
2. Manually copy-paste the relevant sections into these files:

## Core Files
- `/resume/sections/summary.md` - Professional summary/profile
- `/resume/sections/skills.md` - Technical skills organized by categories
- `/resume/sections/experience.md` - Work history with achievements
- `/resume/sections/education.md` - Educational background

## Optional Files
- `/resume/sections/projects.md` - Any notable projects
- `/resume/sections/certifications.md` - Professional certifications

## Template Structure
Templates have been created for each file with appropriate markdown formatting. Simply:
1. Open each file
2. Replace the template content with your actual resume content
3. Save the file

This manual approach will ensure your resume content is properly organized in the correct structure.
