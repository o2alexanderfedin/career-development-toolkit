# Resume Sections

Since we don't have PDF text extraction tools available, please manually add content to these sections based on your current resume:

1. `skills.md` - Technical skills, technologies, methodologies
2. `summary.md` - Professional summary/profile
3. `experience.md` - Work history and professional experience 
4. `education.md` - Educational background
5. `projects.md` - Notable projects (if applicable)
6. `certifications.md` - Professional certifications (if applicable)

You can either copy-paste from your original resume document or create new content for each section.

I've created template files with headers for each section to make this process easier.
