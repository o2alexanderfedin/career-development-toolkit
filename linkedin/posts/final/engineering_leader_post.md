ðŸš€ Leading a high-velocity engineering team where agentic AI amplifies our capabilities.

As engineering leader of our product team:
âœ… XP + Kanban hybrid approach - 2-week cycles with continuous flow optimization
âœ… Architecture-first mindset: clear boundaries, explicit interfaces, and thorough design reviews
âœ… Automated testing and CI/CD that cut deployment time from 2 days to 3 hours
âœ… Living documentation that evolves with our codebase
âœ… Strategic open-sourcing of components that benefit the community

Our agentic AI approach:
ðŸ”¹ Accelerates documentation and knowledge sharing (3hrs â†’ 20min per feature)
ðŸ”¹ Enhances architecture decisions through rapid prototyping
ðŸ”¹ Automates root cause analysis, reducing MTTR from days to hours
ðŸ”¹ Strengthens security by identifying edge cases human reviews missed
ðŸ”¹ Maintains momentum while improving code quality

The result? In just 2 months: feature delivery improved from 3/month to 21/month while maintaining reliability, with defect rate dropping from 4% to 0.8%.

Open to discussing leadership opportunities where innovative engineering practices matter.
